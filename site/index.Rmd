To build upon the existing work in which we generated additive heritability estimates across the UK biobank traits, we have now generated and curated a collection of genetic correlations between each of traits and disorders.

The subset of traits that we host here represent the collection of traits with medium or high confidence of significant $h^2$ as detailed on our hertitability results website. Please click below to explore the results and download the data!

#### FAQ

**Where can I find the heritability results?**

Weâ€™ve built a [browser](https://ukbb-rg.hail.is/rg_browser/) to allow you to peruse the results. You can also download the full correlation results file <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g28ee03vy4hvqw5/AADAkDbSFHsYE8bme1Jjeekca/ldsc_results?dl=0" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g28ee03vy4hvqw5/AADAkDbSFHsYE8bme1Jjeekca/ldsc_results?dl=0'); return false;">full correlation results file</a>.

**What method have you used to estimate genetic correlation?**

We use [LD score regression to estimate genetic correlation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4495769/). Full code and technical details are available in the [github repository](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc). We have added some flags to enable more rapid evaluation of $r_g$ across a large collection of phenotypes at the ldsc repository [here](https://github.com/astheeggeggs/ldsc).

**Are the primary GWAS results used for this analysis available? **

Absolutely! GWAS results are [available for download](https://sites.google.com/broadinstitute.org/ukbbgwasresults/). Please check out [this introductory post](http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/7/19/rapid-gwas-of-thousands-of-phenotypes-for-337000-samples-in-the-uk-biobank) for much more information.
